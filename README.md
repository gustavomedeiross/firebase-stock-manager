# Firebase Stock System
A simple stock system using vanilla JS and vanilla CSS

This project was my first experience ever to making ajax calls and integrating a frontend to a backend. 

I used Google's Firebase for the back-end, and vanilla JS and vanilla CSS for the Front-end.

It's a very simple project/system, but it's something.

Feel free to test it out and give me any tips if you wan't (Any help will be appreciated!).
